# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer-
Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer is all about how a DSA algorithm works we understand its working by visualizing it in a simple way.
there are multiple options to select Algorithm and types of speed to understand the process of working much better.
Maze option is to check how the algorithm works in a different conditions.
We can create a weighted wall for algorithm which supports weight by pressing W and selecting a grid.
Weight is used to check how a algorithm will perform under such conditions will it take a long path or overcome the weight path and gives a shortest path!

to deploy it on your personal computer download and run the Index.html file :)
